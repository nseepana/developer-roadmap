# Complex Data Structures

Complex data structures are designed to handle various forms of data more efficiently and are essential for solving more sophisticated computational problems. Here's a brief overview of some key complex data structures:

1. **Trees**:
   - **Function**: Represent hierarchical data.
   - **Types**:
     - **Binary Trees**: Each node has up to two children.
     - **AVL Trees**: Self-balancing binary search trees.
     - **Red-Black Trees**: Balanced tree, similar to AVL but with different balancing rules.
   - **Usage**: Widely used in databases, file systems, and in various forms of algorithms.

2. **Graphs**:
   - **Structure**: Consist of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting them.
   - **Types**:
     - **Directed Graphs**: Edges have a direction.
     - **Undirected Graphs**: Edges are bidirectional.
   - **Usage**: Used in network analysis, social networking sites, and route planning systems.

3. **Hash Tables**:
   - **Mechanism**: Use a hash function to map keys to indices in an array.
   - **Characteristics**: Provide fast data lookup and insertion.
   - **Usage**: Common in database indexing, caching, and associative arrays.

4. **Heaps**:
   - **Type**: A complete binary tree where each node follows a specific property (min-heap or max-heap).
   - **Usage**: Used in priority queues, heap sort, and for efficient minimum or maximum value retrieval.

These complex data structures are the building blocks of many efficient algorithms and are fundamental to computer science, aiding in the optimization of data handling, storage, and retrieval processes.
