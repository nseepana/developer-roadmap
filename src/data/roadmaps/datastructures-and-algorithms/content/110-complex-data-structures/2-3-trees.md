# 2-3 Trees

## Overview
- **Type**: A balanced tree data structure.
- **Characteristic**: Every node has either two or three children.

## Structure
- **Nodes**: 
  - **2-node**: Has one key and two children.
  - **3-node**: Has two keys and three children.
- **Balanced Nature**: All leaves are at the same depth, ensuring balance.

## Features
1. **Self-Balancing**: Automatically balances itself during insertions and deletions.
2. **Search Time**: Provides efficient search time, similar to binary search trees.

## Insertion
- **Process**:
  - New keys are inserted into a leaf node.
  - If the leaf node is a 2-node, it becomes a 3-node.
  - If it's a 3-node, the node is split, and the middle value is moved up to the parent.
- **Balancing**: The tree restructures itself to maintain its balanced property.

## Deletion
- **Handling**: Involves redistributing keys among nodes or merging nodes to maintain balance.

## Applications
- **Database Systems**: Used in databases for efficient data access and storage.
- **File Systems**: Applicable in file systems for indexing and quick data retrieval.

## Advantages
- **Efficiency**: Ensures data is stored in a balanced manner, leading to efficient operations.
- **Predictable Performance**: The structure of the tree guarantees that operations like search, insertion, and deletion are consistently fast.

2-3 trees are a fundamental type of balanced tree useful in various applications where balanced and efficient data storage and retrieval are critical. Their self-balancing nature and structured organization make them a robust choice in the realm of complex data structures.
