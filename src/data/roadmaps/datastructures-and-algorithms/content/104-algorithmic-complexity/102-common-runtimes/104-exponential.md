# Exponential Time Complexity (O(2^n))

## Definition
- **Notation**: Represented as O(2^n).
- **Characteristic**: The time complexity doubles with each additional element in the input set.

## Behavior
- **Growth Pattern**: Shows an exponential growth in the number of steps as the input size 'n' increases.
- **Implication**: Even a small increase in the input size can lead to a significant increase in the computational effort.

## Examples
- **Fibonacci Sequence (Naive Recursive Approach)**: Each call generates two more calls, leading to an exponential number of calls.
- **Towers of Hanoi Problem**: The solution involves recursively moving disks between pegs, doubling the steps with each additional disk.

## Efficiency
- **Simple to Implement**: Often, algorithms with exponential time complexity are simpler and more straightforward to code.
- **Impractical for Large Inputs**: Despite their simplicity, these algorithms become highly impractical and inefficient as the input size grows, due to the rapid increase in computation time.

## Context
- **Use Case**: While not suitable for large-scale problems, exponential algorithms may still be useful for small input sizes or for problems where no better algorithmic solution is known.
