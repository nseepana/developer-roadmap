# Factorial Time Complexity (O(n!))

## Definition
- **Notation**: Represented as O(n!), where 'n!' is the factorial of 'n'.
- **Operation**: Factorial of a non-negative integer 'n' is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to 'n'.

## Characteristics
- **Growth Rate**: Exhibits an extremely high growth rate in computational steps as the input size increases.
- **Computation**: For an input size of 'n', the algorithm performs `n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 1` operations.

## Context in Algorithm Complexity
- **Worst-Case Scenario**: Factorial complexity is typically the highest level of complexity for an algorithm.
- **Use Case**: Common in brute-force algorithms where all possible combinations or permutations are considered.
- **Example**: The traveling salesman problem, when approached through a brute-force method.

## Efficiency
- **Practicality**: Highly impractical for large input sizes due to the rapid and massive increase in the number of operations required.
- **Application**: While often not feasible for real-world applications with large 'n', it is relevant in theoretical analysis and for small input sizes where exhaustive searches are feasible.

## Implication
- **Comparison with Other Complexities**: Compared to other complexities like polynomial (O(n^k)) or exponential (O(2^n)), factorial time complexity (O(n!)) grows at an even more accelerated pace, making it the most computationally intensive among common complexity classes.
