# Linear Time Complexity (O(n))

## Definition
- **Notation**: Expressed as O(n).
- **Characteristic**: The running time of the algorithm increases linearly with the size of the input.

## Understanding Linear Complexity
- **Input Relation**: If the input size doubles, the running time at most doubles.
- **Processing Method**: Ideally, each element of the input is examined or processed exactly once.

## Examples
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Counting sort and bucket sort, under specific conditions, exhibit linear time complexity.
- **Simple Operations**: Scanning through an array or list once, to perform operations like finding a maximum or minimum value.

## Significance
- **Efficiency**: Among various complexity classes, linear time complexity is often seen as highly efficient, especially for moderate-sized inputs.
- **Real-world Relevance**: Ideal for scenarios where each piece of input data needs individual attention, ensuring comprehensiveness in processing.
