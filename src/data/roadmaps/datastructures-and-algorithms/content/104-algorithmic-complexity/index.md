# Algorithmic Complexity

## Definition
- **Concept**: Algorithmic Complexity is concerned with the amount of computing resources required by an algorithm to solve a given problem.
- **Resources**: This includes both time taken (time complexity) and memory space used (space complexity) during the execution of the algorithm.

## Goals
- **Optimization**: The primary objective is to minimize these resources.
- **Efficiency Criteria**: An algorithm is deemed more efficient if it requires less time and space.

## Measurement
- **Big O Notation**: Complexity is commonly expressed using Big O notation.
  - **Purpose**: This notation describes the upper limit of time or space requirements.
  - **Growth Relation**: It explains how these requirements increase in relation to the size of the input.

## Significance
- **Analysis and Application**: Understanding algorithmic complexity is crucial for selecting or designing the most suitable algorithm for a particular scenario.
- **Efficiency Assessment**: It aids in evaluating the performance and scalability of algorithms in different contexts.
