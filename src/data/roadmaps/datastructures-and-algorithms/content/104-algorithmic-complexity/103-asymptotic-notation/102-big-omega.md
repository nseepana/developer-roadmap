# Big-Ω Notation

## Definition
- **Purpose**: Big Omega (Ω) notation is used in computer science for describing the lower bound of an algorithm's performance.
- **Aspect of Analysis**: It focuses on the worst-case analysis, setting a baseline for the minimum efficiency of an algorithm.

## Understanding Ω-notation
- **Expression**: When a function f(n) is described as Ω(g(n)), it implies:
  - **Lower Bound**: From a certain point (n0) onward, g(n) serves as a minimum threshold for f(n).
  - **Performance Criterion**: f(n) is guaranteed to be at least as fast or efficient as g(n) beyond this threshold.

## Application
- **Interpretation**: The Ω notation indicates that the algorithm will not execute more efficiently than what the Ω complexity suggests. 
- **Example**: If an algorithm has a time complexity of Ω(n³), it means the algorithm's performance cannot be faster than cubic growth relative to the input size for sufficiently large inputs.

## Importance
- **Analysis Insight**: Big Omega notation provides a crucial insight into the minimum guaranteed performance of an algorithm, enabling an understanding of its lower limits in terms of efficiency and resource utilization.
