# Time vs Space Complexity

## Time Complexity
- **Definition**: Time complexity refers to the amount of computational time an algorithm takes to execute.
- **Measurement**: It is quantified as the time taken by an algorithm to run, relative to the size of the input.

## Space Complexity
- **Definition**: Space complexity refers to the amount of memory required by an algorithm to complete its operation.
- **Measurement**: It is quantified as the amount of space or memory used by an algorithm, again in relation to the size of the input.

## Space-Time Tradeoff
- **Key Concept**: Time and space complexities are often inversely related.
- **Implication**: Optimizing an algorithm for speed often requires more memory, while minimizing memory usage can slow down the algorithm. This inverse relationship is known as the space-time tradeoff.
