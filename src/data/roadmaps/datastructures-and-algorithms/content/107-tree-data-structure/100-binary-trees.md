# Binary Trees

## Definition
- **Type**: A tree data structure where each node has a maximum of two children.

## Key Characteristics
- **Children**: Referred to as the left and right child.
- **Distinctive Feature**: Nodes can have zero, one, or two children, setting binary trees apart from trees with unlimited children per node.

## Types of Binary Trees
1. **Strictly Binary Tree**: Each non-leaf node has exactly two children (both non-empty).
2. **Complete Binary Tree**: 
   - All levels are fully filled except possibly the last level.
   - Nodes are as left-justified as possible, meaning they are filled starting from the left.

## Usage and Importance
- **Algorithms and Functions**: Binary trees are utilized in numerous algorithms due to their efficient organization of data and suitability for various operations.
- **Mathematical and Organizational Advantage**: Offer a structured way of representing data with hierarchical relationships, ideal for both mathematical computations and organizational tasks.

## Applications
- **Data Structures**: Form the basis for more specialized trees like Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, and B-Trees.
- **Computing Concepts**: Utilized in algorithms for sorting, searching, and navigating hierarchical data structures.
