# Depth First Search (DFS)

## Overview
- **Type**: An algorithm used for traversing or searching through tree and graph data structures.
- **Starting Point**:
  - **Tree**: Begins at the root.
  - **Graph**: Starts from an arbitrary node.

## Working Mechanism
1. **Deep Exploration**: Prioritizes delving deep into the structure along each branch.
2. **Process**:
   - Visits a node and explores as far as possible along a branch.
   - Upon reaching a node with no unvisited adjacent nodes, it backtracks.
3. **Traversal**: Continues this pattern until all nodes are visited.

## Applications
- **Game State Simulation**: Useful in scenarios like chess or checkers where forecasting various future states is needed.
- **Puzzle Solving**: Employed in solving puzzles like mazes or logic puzzles.
- **Graph Analysis**: Identifying connected components, checking for cycles, and other graph-related queries.

## Characteristics
- **Backtracking Element**: Integral to the algorithm, ensuring no possibility is left unexplored.
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Guarantees that every node will be visited, making it thorough for exhaustive searches.

## Versions
- **Recursive Implementation**: Commonly implemented recursively for its natural backtracking structure.
- **Iterative Approach**: Can also be implemented iteratively, typically using a stack.

## Suitability
- **Use Cases**: Ideal for problems where a complete search is necessary, or where the solution path is as important as the solution itself.
