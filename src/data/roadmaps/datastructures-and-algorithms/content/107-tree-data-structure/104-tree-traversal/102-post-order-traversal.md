# Post-Order Traversal

## Description
- **Type**: A method of tree traversal in binary trees.
- **Process**: Nodes are processed after their child nodes.

## Traversal Order
1. **Left Subtree**: Begins with the traversal of the left subtree.
2. **Right Subtree**: Continues to the right subtree.
3. **Root Node**: Finally, processes the root node.

## Implementation
- **Recursive Approach**: Commonly implemented using recursion, visiting left and right subtrees and then processing the root.
- **Iterative Methods**: Can also be done iteratively, typically using a stack to maintain traversal order.

## Usage
- **Calculations**: Useful in situations where it's essential to process all child nodes before their parent node.
- **Applications**:
  - **Mathematical Expressions**: Evaluating expressions represented in a tree, where operators depend on operands (children).
  - **Tree Deletions**: Often used in safely deleting nodes from a tree, ensuring no references are lost during the process.

## Characteristics
- **Order of Evaluation**: Ensures that subtrees are fully dealt with before action is taken on the root or parent nodes.
- **Tree Manipulation**: Essential for operations that require a 'bottom-up' approach in trees.

## Significance
- Post-order traversal is integral in various applications within computer science, particularly those involving hierarchical structures or expressions that require a dependency-based evaluation order.
