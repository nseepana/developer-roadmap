# Tree Traversal

## Overview
- **Purpose**: Tree traversal refers to the process of visiting each node in a tree data structure exactly once in a systematic way.

## Main Types of Traversal
1. **Preorder Traversal**
   - **Order**: Visits the current node before its child nodes.
   - **Pattern**: Root → Left Subtree → Right Subtree.

2. **Inorder Traversal**
   - **Order**: Visits the left child, then the parent, and finally the right child.
   - **Pattern**: Left Subtree → Root → Right Subtree.
   - **Note**: Produces nodes in non-decreasing order for binary search trees.

3. **Postorder Traversal**
   - **Order**: Visits the child nodes before their respective parents.
   - **Pattern**: Left Subtree → Right Subtree → Root.

4. **Level Order Traversal**
   - **Method**: Visits nodes level by level starting from the root.
   - **Associated Algorithm**: Typically implemented using Breadth-First Search (BFS).

## Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth First Search (BFS)
- **DFS**: Involves deeply exploring the tree, prioritizing going forward in the tree as much as possible, then backtracking.
- **BFS**: Starts from the root and explores nodes in a level-by-level manner.

## Applications
- **Traversal Selection**: The choice of traversal method depends on the specific requirement of the operation or the algorithm being implemented.
- **Use Cases**: Used in a variety of operations, from searching and sorting to restructuring and analyzing tree structures.

## Significance
- **Tree Analysis**: Traversal is fundamental in tree analysis, allowing for comprehensive examination and manipulation of the tree data structure.
