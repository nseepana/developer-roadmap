# Pre-Order Traversal

## Overview
- **Type**: A specific method of tree traversal in data structures.
- **Traversal Order**: Root node first, followed by the left subtree, and then the right subtree.

## Traversal Sequence
1. **Root Node**: Begins with visiting the root node.
2. **Left Subtree**: Continues to traverse the left subtree.
3. **Right Subtree**: Finally, moves to the right subtree.

## Implementation
- **Recursive Approach**: Commonly executed through recursion, processing the root and then recursively traversing left and right subtrees.
- **Iterative Methods**: Can also be achieved iteratively, typically involving a stack to track the nodes.

## Applications
- **Tree Cloning/Duplication**: Useful for replicating the tree structure.
- **Prefix Expression (Polish Notation)**: Employed in obtaining a prefix form of a binary expression tree.
- **Tree Manipulation**: Effective for operations that require processing a parent before its children, such as when manipulating tree nodes.

## Characteristics
- **Traversal Pattern**: Ensures that each node and its children are visited before any siblings.
- **Order of Evaluation**: Particularly suitable for scenarios where the priority is to deal with the root before its subtrees.

## Importance
- Pre-order traversal is especially useful in scenarios where the hierarchy or root-centric processing of a tree is critical, such as in certain forms of tree-based computations and expression evaluations.
