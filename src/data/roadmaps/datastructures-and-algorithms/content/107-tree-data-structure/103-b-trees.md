# B-Trees

## Overview
- **Type**: A self-balanced tree data structure.
- **Purpose**: Efficiently manages sorted data, particularly for disk-based storage systems.

## Characteristics
- **Balancing**: Ensures that all leaves are at the same level, contributing to its balance.
- **Node Composition**: Each node can store multiple keys and has corresponding pointers.
- **Separation Values**: Keys in a node act as separators that divide the range of values into subranges, each managed by a subtree.

## Functionality
- **Search Operations**: Allows for efficient searching, similar to binary search on each node.
- **Insertions and Deletions**: Maintains balance after these operations, ensuring efficient performance.

## Node Structure
- **Keys**: Contain values that are used to organize and navigate the tree.
- **Pointers**: Each node has pointers to its child nodes.
- **Capacity**: Each node can hold a maximum and a minimum number of keys, defined by the tree's order.

## Example
- **Node Values**: If a node has keys [10, 20, 30]:
  - First child contains values <10.
  - Second child contains values between 10 and 20.
  - Third child contains values between 20 and 30.
  - Fourth child contains values >30.

## Usage
- **Applications**: Widely used in databases and file systems for handling large volumes of data.
- **Disk Operations**: Optimized for systems where read and write operations to the disk are costly.

## Advantages
- **Efficiency**: Provides a good balance between the need for quick search, insert, and delete operations.
- **Disk Storage Optimization**: Minimizes disk accesses, making it suitable for storage that involves large blocks of data, like hard drives.

## Significance
- **Data Organization**: B-Trees are crucial for efficiently organizing and retrieving data in systems with large datasets and disk-based storage, ensuring high performance and scalability.
