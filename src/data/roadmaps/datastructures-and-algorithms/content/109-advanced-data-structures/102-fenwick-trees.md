# Fenwick Trees (Binary Indexed Trees)

## Definition
- **Type**: A specialized data structure for efficient computation of cumulative frequency or prefix sum.
- **Alternate Name**: Binary Indexed Tree (BIT).

## Purpose
- **Operations**: Supports two primary operations effectively:
  1. **Update**: Modifies an element in the array.
  2. **Query**: Calculates the sum of a range of elements.

## Efficiency
- **Time Complexity**: Both update and query operations are performed in O(log n) time.
- **Compared to Arrays**: More efficient than using simple arrays for repetitive sum and update operations.

## Structure
- **Partial Sum Storage**: Stores cumulative sums or frequency counts in a tree-like structure within an array.
- **Index Representation**: Uses binary representation of indexes for efficient calculation.

## Applications
- **Use Cases**: Ideal in scenarios with frequent updates and range sum queries, like in:
  - Computational finance for cumulative frequencies.
  - Data analysis tasks involving cumulative statistics.

## Advantages
- **Space Efficiency**: Requires less space compared to segment trees.
- **Operation Speed**: Both updation and sum queries are faster compared to simple array or prefix sum array implementations.

Fenwick Trees are a powerful tool in the arsenal of advanced data structures, offering a blend of efficiency and simplicity, especially for problems that involve frequent updates and queries over an array. They provide a practical approach for efficient data manipulation and retrieval in logarithmic time.
