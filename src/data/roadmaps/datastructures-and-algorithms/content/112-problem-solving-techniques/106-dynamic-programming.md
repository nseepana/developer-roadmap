# Dynamic Programming

## Concept
- **Approach**: An optimization technique that breaks down complex problems into simpler subproblems.
- **Foundation**: Based on *Bellman's Principle of Optimality*.

## Mechanism
- **Subproblems**: Solves each subproblem once and stores the result.
- **Memoization**: Utilizes memory (typically arrays or dictionaries) to store and retrieve results of subproblem solutions.
- **Overlap**: Ideal for problems where subproblems recur frequently.

## Types
1. **Top-Down Approach (Memoization)**:
   - Starts solving the problem by breaking it down.
   - Stores the result of each subproblem for future reference.

2. **Bottom-Up Approach (Tabulation)**:
   - Builds up solutions to larger and larger subproblems.
   - Often involves filling up a table based on previously solved smaller subproblems.

## Applications
- **Computer Science**: Algorithms for shortest paths, text editing, machine learning algorithms.
- **Mathematics and Economics**: Optimization problems in various domains.

## Advantages
- **Efficiency**: Reduces the time complexity significantly in certain problems.
- **Reusability**: Avoids redundant calculations by reusing previously computed results.

Dynamic Programming is a cornerstone technique in algorithm design, enabling the efficient solution of problems that would otherwise be too computationally intensive. It is particularly powerful for problems characterized by overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure properties.
