# Graph Data Structure

## Overview
- **Definition**: A graph is a collection of vertices (or nodes) and edges connecting these vertices.
- **Visualization**: Often represented as interconnected networks, with vertices as points and edges as lines linking these points.

## Types of Graphs
1. **Directed Graphs**:
   - **Characteristics**: Edges have a direction, signifying a one-way relationship.
   - **Example**: In a road network, a directed edge could represent a one-way street.

2. **Undirected Graphs**:
   - **Characteristics**: Edges are bidirectional, indicating a two-way relationship.
   - **Example**: In a social network, an undirected edge could represent a mutual friendship.

## Weighted vs. Unweighted Graphs
- **Weighted Graphs**: Edges have weights or costs, adding an extra layer of information. This is important in scenarios like pathfinding in a network.
- **Unweighted Graphs**: Edges do not have additional information like weight or cost.

## Applications
- **Computer Networks**: Modeling and managing network connections.
- **Social Networks**: Mapping relationships and connections.
- **Web Page Linking**: Representing links between web pages for search engine algorithms.
- **Geographical Maps**: Road networks, where vertices are locations and edges are roads.

## Importance
- **Flexibility**: Graphs can model a wide range of real-world structures and problems.
- **Diverse Algorithms**: Different graph algorithms are applicable for tasks like searching (DFS, BFS), shortest path finding (Dijkstraâ€™s, A*), and network flow problems (Ford-Fulkerson).

Graph data structures are essential in computer science due to their versatility in representing and solving complex relationships and networked systems.
