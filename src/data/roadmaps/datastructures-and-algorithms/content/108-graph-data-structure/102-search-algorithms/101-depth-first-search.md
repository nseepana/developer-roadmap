# Depth-First Search (DFS)

## Overview
- **Type**: An algorithm for traversing or searching through trees and graphs.
- **Approach**: Prioritizes delving deep into a branch before backtracking.

## Mechanism
1. **Starting Point**: Begins at a root node (or an arbitrary node in the case of a graph).
2. **Traversal**:
   - Explores as far down a path as possible.
   - Uses a stack (either actual or through recursion) to track the path.
3. **Backtracking**:
   - When a path ends (a dead end), it backtracks to explore new paths.

## Characteristics
- **Stack Utilization**: Follows a Last In, First Out (LIFO) method to manage nodes during traversal.
- **Exhaustive Path Exploration**: Thoroughly explores each path before moving on to another.

## Applications
- **Connected Components**: Useful in identifying connected components in a graph.
- **Topological Sorting**: Employed in scenarios requiring the ordering of elements with dependencies, such as task scheduling.
- **Articulation Points**: Effective in finding critical vertices or cut vertices that increase graph connectivity.

## Significance
- **Versatility**: DFS is a foundational algorithm in graph theory, applied in a variety of computational problems.
- **Efficiency**: While it can be computationally intensive, its depth-focused exploration makes it efficient for problems requiring comprehensive path analysis.
