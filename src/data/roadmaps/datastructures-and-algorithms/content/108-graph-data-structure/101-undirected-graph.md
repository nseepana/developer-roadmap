# Undirected Graph

## Definition
- **Type**: A graph where the edges are bidirectional.
- **Edge Nature**: Edges in an undirected graph do not have a direction or orientation.

## Characteristics
- **Endpoints**: Edges connect two vertices without specifying a starting or ending point.
- **Two-Way Relationship**: The edges represent a mutual connection, allowing movement or connection in both directions.
- **No Ordered Pairs**: Unlike directed graphs, edges are not defined as ordered pairs.

## Representation
- **Visual Depiction**: Typically depicted with lines connecting nodes, without arrows to indicate direction.
- **Adjacency**: Often represented in data structures like adjacency matrices or lists without regard to directionality.

## Applications
- **Social Networks**: To represent mutual relationships, like friendships.
- **Road Maps**: Where roads allow for two-way traffic.
- **Network Topology**: In scenarios where the direction of connection is not significant.

## Implications
- **Traversal**: Algorithms traversing undirected graphs don't need to consider the direction of edges, simplifying some operations.
- **Connectivity**: They often focus on whether a path exists between nodes, rather than the direction of the path.

Undirected graphs are widely used in computer science and related fields for modeling and solving problems where relationships are inherently bidirectional or where the direction of connection is not a relevant factor.
