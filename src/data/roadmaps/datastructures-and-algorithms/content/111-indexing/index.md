# Database Indexing

## Definition
- **Purpose**: Indexing is a technique used to expedite the retrieval of data from a database.
- **Function**: Works like a lookup table, facilitating quick data location without scanning every record.

## Index Structure
- **Based On**: Created using one or more columns of a database table.
- **Types**: Can be structured as Binary Trees, B-Trees, Hash Maps, etc.
  - **Binary Trees**: Good for data that is frequently read but less frequently modified.
  - **B-Trees**: Common in databases; efficient for a range of searching operations.
  - **Hash Maps**: Ideal for rapid data retrieval with exact match queries.

## Benefits
- **Efficiency in Retrieval**: Drastically reduces data access time, especially in large databases.
- **Query Performance**: Enhances the speed of data retrieval operations.

## Considerations
- **Disk Space**: Indexes consume additional disk space.
- **Maintenance**: Require maintenance which can affect write performance (insertions and updates).
- **Selection**: Choosing the correct index type is vital for optimizing database performance.

## Application
- **Optimization**: Used to optimize query speed by minimizing disk reads.
- **Selective Use**: Best used on columns frequently involved in the search conditions or join conditions.

Properly utilized, indexing is a powerful tool for managing and accessing large datasets in a database. The key lies in creating and maintaining them judiciously to balance between read and write performance.
